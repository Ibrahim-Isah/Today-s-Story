# Today-s-Story
Today has being quite a stressful day, being working on a feature with a stack i am not fully familiar with, but as a developer, you have to get your task done. We learn everyday and i hope that one day, i would live to tell the story of my struggle. The goal is to make momma and poppa proud. Inshaa Allah we will do that. I will take a rest for now and continue tomorow. Cheers
